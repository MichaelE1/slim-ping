# Tanda Ping Challenge 

This is a solution to the [Tanda Ping challenge](https://github.com/TandaHQ/work-samples/tree/master/pings%20(backend)) using Slim, a PHP micro framework and SQLite.

[This page](https://www.slimframework.com/docs/v3/start/web-servers.html) does a great job of explaining how to run the solution.

This was my first and only time using Slim. I also wrote this back in 2016, before I knew GitHub was a thing. It was a simpler time.
